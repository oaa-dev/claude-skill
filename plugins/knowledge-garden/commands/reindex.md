# Reindex Knowledge Base

Regenerate `docs/knowledge/index.md` by scanning all solution files and extracting their frontmatter into a compact lookup table.

<instructions>

Execute the full knowledge-index skill workflow:

1. Verify `docs/knowledge/solutions/` exists. If not: "Run /knowledge-garden:setup to initialize knowledge-garden first."
2. Glob all solution files in `docs/knowledge/solutions/**/*.md`
3. Read `docs/knowledge/patterns/critical-patterns.md` and extract pattern names + file references
4. Scan module docs: Glob `docs/knowledge/modules/*.md`. For each, read first 40 lines to extract module name, file count, key components, and relationships. Skip if none found.
5. For each solution file, read the first 20 lines to extract YAML frontmatter (parallel batches of 10)
6. Write `docs/knowledge/index.md` with the standard index format (header with counts, Critical Patterns section, Modules table, Solutions table sorted by date descending)
7. Report: solutions indexed, skipped, critical patterns count, modules indexed

See the knowledge-index skill for the full index file format specification.
